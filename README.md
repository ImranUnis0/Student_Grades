# Student Grades Prediction Model
This project demonstrates a Polynomial Regression Model designed to analyze the relationship between students' Study Hours and their Final Grades. The model aims to predict how changes in study hours impact final grades, providing actionable insights for students and educators.

# Key Features
1 Polynomial Regression:

Captures the non-linear relationship between study hours and final grades.

Shows how increasing study hours affects academic performance.

2 Training and Testing:

The model is trained on real-world data to ensure accurate predictions.

Testing evaluates the model's reliability in unseen scenarios.

3 Insights:

Helps students understand how additional study time can boost their grades.
Assists educators in identifying trends to guide student improvement.

# How It Works

1 Input: The dataset includes students' study hours and their final grades.

2 Processing: Polynomial regression is applied to model the curve of impact.

3 Output: The predicted final grades based on given study hours.
